# SyllabusSync

## Project Overview

SyllabusSync is a student planner platform that helps Cornell students organize course deadlines by intelligently parsing syllabi and syncing important dates to their calendars.
The platform automatically extracts key deadlines, exam dates, and weighted assessments from uploaded syllabi and provides seamless calendar integration, allowing students to stay organized and focused on their studies rather than manual administrative tasks.
